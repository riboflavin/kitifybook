What this book is about
Have you ever thought of putting together a do it yourself kit for someone to do one of your projects? People who do this have many goals. You might want to do this in order to teach other people how to do your project. Or, you might want to do it because other people are interested in owning a project you've put together, but nobody produces it and a kit is a cheaper way to distribute your invention. As another possibility, maybe you want to create a kit as a project for yourself – all the necessities of a kit, including getting parts, instructions, and thinking carefully about how to explain a project to someone else, can be a really helpful way to learn things yourself.
Kits can encompass a lot of different possibilities. You can think of a first aid kit, which contains all the necessary parts to triage a broad range of minor injuries. Or there are small business kits, which contain lots of things you need to start a small business, such as tax forms, legal forms, and advice. Even drums are often arranged in a drum kit, which contains all the necessary instruments to play a broad range of percussive arrangements. You can probably think of other uses of the word kit as well.
Overall, a kit is a collection of parts that allows someone to do something. I also think of a real kit as something somewhat more profound – it's a way of externalizing knowledge, of taking it out of someone's head and making it into a group of artifacts. Thought of this way, a kit is extremely powerful – it's a conversion of knowledge into matter. Well-planned, it's a way of transmitting skills and abilities without the necessity of a human teacher. This guide is about helping you make a kit into all it can be.
While much of the advice of this guide will be useful for many different instructional situations, we're really focused on kits that help someone build or learn something, and ideally something physical. There are lots of famous kits like this, and they're becoming increasingly popular – Shelby car kits, for example, or the first Apple computers, or even chemistry sets are collections of things that are meant to transmit abilities and knowledge.
This type of kit has an even more powerful attribute, which is that it allows someone to learn in a new way. A lot of the time, we learn through books and conversations, that is to say, through words alone. But a well-constructed kit can teach someone by doing, which is a far more powerful way of learning (and easier for many people). Once you build a kit, you have to grapple with all the confusion and difficulty inherent in learning a concept, but you have a guide to help you along the way.
The goal of this guide is to help you create kits that are economical to produce and sell and straightforward to do (not unchallenging, but not presenting artificial obstacles), and help you market and sell these kits. This is the closest thing available to a kit-making kit, I guess is what we're saying. We present the information in this guide in a logical order, based on the order in which you'll probably undertake steps to build your kit. This guide contains the following chapters:
  •  Coming up with kit ideas
	•	Writing kit instructions
	•	Sourcing supplies
	•	Packaging your kit
	•	Marketing your kit
	•	Creating a community
	•	Analysis of several kits
Why should you care about kit design?
There are several things that designing your kit well achieves. The first is cost control. By thinking carefully about what parts are really needed for your project, and what parts can be left out, you'll save money on materials and lower your upfront investment in an initial run. More importantly, you'll also save money on kit support and refunds. Kit support is one of the most expensive parts of selling kits, since it takes up time, and potentially an unlimited amount at that; kit support may also require you to send replacement parts and make other corrections that can eat up profit. If kit support fails, you'll end up having to take kits back; even if you're able to resell them (which you may not be able to do if a user has partially completed the kit) you still incur shipping costs and poor word of mouth, which decreases users' motivation to recommend your kit to their friends. Poorly-made components are the cause of many of these problems, and can end up costing you more than you would have spent by buying quality components in the first place. Lastly, kit design is important because design, in general, brings about a better mood in the user. A better mood means that users are more fault-tolerant and more willing to accept problems and apply creativity to solving them. Something that's poorly designed, on the other hand, makes users frustrated easily. Imagine a kit where the build process melts away, instructions are easily followed, and the correct parts are easily found. Aside from the logistical advantages of knowing they are doing everything correctly, such assurances make it easier for the user to build the kit successfully in the first place. Also, sourcing parts is expensive – you have to buy wholesale to sell retail (thousands of units). This is a big risk especially if you make a design mistake.
Coming up with kit ideas
There are many reasons why you might choose to make a kit. All of them assume that you have done some project that you'd like to share with the world. If you're reading this guide, it's likely that you'd like to make some money in the process, too. Making kits is a lot of work, however, so you want to be relatively sure that the work you put in will be rewarded. Otherwise, it might make more sense for you to simply post instructions and bills of materials for others to follow, or talk about your project on your blog or other personal journal, and field inquiries when people have them.
There are a few different sources of kit ideas:
	•	Original projects you've done. This is probably the most popular source of ideas. You tinker around and figure out how to build something cool. Then, you turn that knowledge into a kit so others can build this cool thing. Usually, when you are building a kit in this case, it's at least partly because you don't have the capital required to actually manufacture a product, and building a kit is a good substitute for that. That's OK, and making a kit is a great way to test demand for an idea and work out the bugs before you consider manufacturing it.
	•	Projects that other people have come up with. This is an interesting source too – as an outside observer, you also have an advantage because you can look more critically at the project and decide whether and how to turn it into a kit. You might be able to come up with a cheaper or better way to do something that they've missed.
	•	Taking an existing product, and turning it into a kit for the purposes of innovating. This is a great source for kits, especially because in doing so you can create an entire community around the kit idea, and possibly turn it into an exciting, low cost open source product. This can then be built up over time into a disruptive innovation with many of the characteristics of the original product. Heathkit's philosophy was not to invent new products, but to look for things that are already popular, then build a DIY kit for them.
	•	Taking an existing skill, and finding a product that teaches it, and then building a kit around that.
Once you've come up with your kit idea, or ideas, you want to consider the following.
	•	One of the first things to consider is whether your kit can indeed be done by someone else. Is your project simple enough that you can easily explain it to others, and that others may want to do it? Something that seems relatively simple to you may actually depend on the years of knowledge you've accumulated, or some special skill that you have (many woodworking projects fall into this category – easy for experts, but almost impossible for amateurs who don't have the right tools and training). 
	•	Are the materials that your kit requires readily-sourced? If you are considering a kit to grow a rare plant, for example, consider how difficult it might be to acquire the seeds. If you have a specific electronics project that you've built, be careful if you depend on a part that only one store makes, or that is very expensive. There are ways to get around this constraint through thoughtful kit design that substitutes cheap parts for expensive ones with the option to upgrade later or on a second build of the kit.
	•	Can your kit be shipped easily? Homebrewing kits, for example, tend to be incomplete since they require rather lots of heavy and fragile equipment – either you buy this from the store, in which case you may as well buy everything from the store at once, or you only buy a homebrewing kit if you already have the necessary materials. I built a vacuum-forming machine once that required a large piece of medium-density fiberboard – very, very cheap to buy but extremely expensive to ship and therefore probably not worth including in a kit. Obviously, if you already run a store or expect your customers to come to you, you have a lot more flexibility.
	•	What's the audience for your kit? You have to make some decisions early on about who you think will be interested in buying your kit. "Everyone!" is not a great answer. Ideally, you have an example in mind of the kind of person you think you can sell to, and also where you can find them. If you're making an electronics kit, maybe you're a member of a hackerspace or makerspace that can give you some leads – or if you're making a craft kit, you may be able to look to the same communities for help. Many larger kit stores, such as Maker Shed, will agree to include a kit for you in their catalog, which is a great source of customers and marketing (one of the hardest parts of kit selling). If your kit is really cool, you might be able to ink a deal with a major retailer for your kit or for the fully-built version of your project; I had a friend who did just that. There are many ways you can test demand for a kit without actually selling it. You can ask around, you can try posting some ads on Google AdWords (though this is expensive). You can even post a Kickstarter with your prototype kit, to see what kind of response you get. The beauty of Kickstarter is that it is essentially a pre-sale platform – if your project is funded (and if you did the math right), you already have enough money to start and finish your production run. 
	•	Can you source parts for your kit economically? This is one of the biggest hurdles in kit selling. You'll be investing a lot of time in your kit, and possibly money as well. You need to be able to sell your kits at a high enough price that you recoup the costs of the parts, and ideally get paid something for the time that you put into developing it. The cheapest thing to do is to source parts from China, which sites such as alibaba will let you do. Alternatively, for your initial run, you can source parts at retail and then start buying wholesale – from suppliers in the US or China – once you've developed some volume.
In regard to all of these points, but especially when determining your audience, you'll also want to think about the reasons why someone will choose to do your kit. There are many reasons people undertake "do-it-yourself" projects:
	•	Wanting to learn a new skill, or new technique. This is a really popular reason for doing a kit – for example, take this circular sewing set.
	•	Wanting to express yourself. Occasionally, people do kits because they want to use their experience to do something, but they don't have the skills to do that thing from scratch. [Example]
	•	Wanting to save time or money. Relatively few kits fit under this description. Normally, building something yourself takes more time – and often more money, as well – than buying whatever it is. There are a couple of exceptions. One is if the product is kit-like, and the kit-like attributes are engineered into the product to create efficiencies. The best example of this is IKEA furniture, which becomes much cheaper to ship and store because it functions like a simple kit when you get it home. Another exception is machines that don't exist, have relatively little demand, or would be very expensive or impossible to manufacture, where allowing people to build the machine themselves makes it economical to sell. Examples of this include 3D printer kits such as the RepRap or MakerBot in their original incarnations.

Selecting parts
[As for your other components, almost everything you can find retail, you can trace back to the manufacturer or wholesaler. It’s worth the search—the price savings can be astounding (we pay less than twenty cents for motors that sell retail for $3).]
It's a good idea to pick quality suppliers for your parts. This may end up saving you a lot of time and trouble down the road. In general, it's great if you can avoid custom parts, but well-suited custom parts can also be a key part of the reason why people will pay for your kit rather than duplicating your project on their own time. If you go the custom route, be sure to work with a supplier who can scale the number of parts they provide to you, and who doesn't have a low defect rate. Another risk with custom parts is that, if you overestimate demand, you may in many cases be able to return or resell parts that you buy. This isn't the case with custom parts.
Writing instructions
We suggest doing this step first, since you can then build your bill of materials from your instructions, rather than trying to imagine everything that will be needed first.
Writing instructions is a surprisingly complex task. In keeping with the central mission of a kit, which is to externalize knowledge into a set of physical artifacts and documentation, this is where the central work happens of thinking about all the steps that are involved in the build process and how to explain them to somebody who (a) doesn't have an intuitive understanding of these steps, and (b) is following somewhat blindly, without a true understanding of how each step leads up to the final goal. People can read instructions before undertaking a build process, but if they knew how to do the project intuitively, they wouldn't need the instructions in the first place. The work is similar to programming – how can we set forth a series of steps that leads to the desired result, while making as few assumptions as possible about the knowledge or abilities of the person executing the instructions.
The first thing you'll want to do is think about the audience for your kit.
	•	Who will do it, and how skilled are they? Picking up from the idea of considering your audience above – will it be children or adults? What language will they expect your instructions to be in? What tools might they already have access to? Does your language need to be simple, or can you refer to complex concepts? Will they know the difference between an M3 and an M4 bolt, or even what a millimeter is? Don't assume that they'll know what you're talking about. 
	•	What do they need to do? This is the core mission of writing the instructions.
	•	When do they need to do it? Are they looking to do this project over a weekend, for example? If so, you probably shouldn't use a glue that takes 48 hours to cure. If you're making a homebrewing kit, are there certain temperature requirements that will be easier or harder to achieve at different times of year?
	•	Where do they need to do it? If your project is a large catapult, should it be built outside to avoid damaging property inside the house? What tools and surfaces should be readily available? For example, are parts of it done in the kitchen because I need a stove?
	•	Why do they need to do it? This is the idea of motivation, which was covered above.
	•	How will they approach the document? There are many different styles of reading instructions, which you might want to consider as you decide who you're writing them for. Many people read over all the instructions before starting, which is helpful but not universal (and for these readers, you may want to make a special effort to explain how each step leads to the final successful conclusion of the kit). Other readers go step by step, so you'll want to avoid specifying or modifying instructions later, in the hope that readers are reading ahead [Example]
The next step is to actually sit down and figure out what steps are involved the building your kit. The easiest way to do this is probably to just explain it out loud, and then write down what you're explaining. Don't worry about the quality of the instructions at this stage.
[Example]
Next, you'll want to break this description down into its different stages. Each step should be just one sentence, and you'll want to do a few things to your writing style to get into the correct instruction-writing mode:
	•	Use action verbs [include list], and use them as commands. "Take…" "Screw in…"
	•	Use short, simple sentences with simple words (no abbreviations, acronyms, or jargon). If you have more than one sentence, it's probably two separate steps. Spell words correctly. Use complete sentences.
	•	Be specific [example]
	•	Specify units of measurement
	•	Warn users of potential problems – is there a simple test that your reader can do to make sure they've done their work correctly? Also include any cautions, tips, or dangers.
	•	Include adequate whitespace.
	•	Advise readers on what they'll see if they did the step correctly.
	•	Time: How long will it take me to finish? (Other measures might be appropriate, like “how much money will I have to spend?” or “how far will I have to drive?”)
	•	Anticipation: What difficulties should I expect to encounter on the way? How should I prepare for the project?; and
	•	Failure: What will happen if I screw up? What does failure look like?
	•	If you do know the level of your audience’s pre-existing knowledge, tailor your instructions to fit. In other words, break the task into th smallest, simplest tasks your audience will understand, and explain each step fully and literally.
	•	If the actual outcome differs from the desired outcome, your instructions (not the user) have failed.
These are good guidelines for the kit as a whole, as well.
Once you've done that, start looking for gaps in your instructions, of which there will be many. The easiest way to do this is to follow each step as it comes, exactly as written (don't add your own knowledge back into the instructions – readers won't be able to do that!) Don't skip obvious steps, either. You might also want to highlight or otherwise mark any materials or objects that you mention, and think carefully about (a) how a user will locate this part within your kit, and (b) how they will know what it is.
Subassemblies
One way to organize your kit logically is by having the builder build subassemblies (smaller parts of the kit that can be built independently). Focusing on these provides several advantages: subassemblies can be partitioned into their own set of instructions, and subassemblies can be checked for correctness before moving on to other parts of the kit. Later, subassemblies can be treated as independent parts for the purposes of further building. Users can also test subassemblies as they're built to make sure everything is working correctly.
Adding photos and line drawings
One thing that's very useful to have together with each step is a drawing or photo of what will happen. (Videos are good too, for obvious reasons, but are harder to use than text instructions). In any drawing or photo, be sure that the active parts are clearly visible and labeled.
Formatting your instructions
Once your instructions are done, there are a few basics you'll want to take care of presentation-wise. Good grammar and spelling is important; in the worst case you'll avoid errors and misunderstandings, and in the best case you'll allow your builder to turn all their attention to your project rather than getting distracted or unsettled by an error. You'll want to make sure your instructions are consistently formatted and reasonably nice-looking as well, for the same reasons. Pick fonts that are easy to read and make sure it's easy to tell which step is which, and it's easy to go back and refer to another step.
Troubleshooting
Ideally, users won't run into problems once they've followed your instructions. However, they may end up with a non-working finally assembled product despite your best efforts. Consider including some kind of brief troubleshooting manual or card with your instructions in case this happens.
Packaging your kit
Kit Titling and Description
Generally, you should try to concisely convey exactly what your kit does, and ideally, the benefits to the user. So, for example, "removing Snow with the Acme Snow Blower" is a better title than just "Acme Snow Blower".
Usability Testing
It’s important that you as the author to practice the instructions you write, but it’s even more important that you get someone else with little to no experience on the subject to follow the instructions. It’s important that you don’t give them any oral information and make notes on places they seem to get hung up on or don’t quite understand. This will let you know if there are any weak points in your instruction. Common wisdom suggests that interviewing 5 users (watching 5 builds) should be enough to find any major problems in your kit – remember that you can probably disassemble the kit afterward if you don't want to give away 5 kits for this purpose. It's at least useful to test with 1 or 2 people so you can see if there are any obvious problems.
Asking for feedback
Make sure that you have some way of getting feedback on your kits from people who will buy them. [Insert example survey]
Ways to simplify the packaging
Unpacking the kit should ideally be an experience that creates good expectations in the user – that the kit parts are well-manufactured, that the completed product will work as advertised, that the instructions are reliable and good value for money, and so on. In addition, the packaging of the kit is practically important to protect the kit parts and can play an important role in kit construction by making the kit parts easy to find when they're needed for a certain step.
There are many ways to package the kit so that it meshes well with your instructions. First off, consider labeling any parts that are not obvious. For example, if some pieces are 20 millimeters long, and others are 30, and others are 40, you can label the packaging for these parts (or the parts themselves) so a user doesn't have to take out a ruler to figure out which part they need to use. You can also consider color-coding your parts for the same reason, which allows you to specify a part labeled with that color in your instructions (e.g. the green bolts are 20mm long, while the red bolts are 40mm long). As another example, if a user might not be able to identify a resistor or a capacitor immediately, consider labeling these as well. Labeling is more helpful than simply providing a picture, since pictures don't immediately show you what the relevant details are, and are of little help when trying to make sure that users have, for example, parts with certain dimensions. Secondly, consider the way in which you group parts. Ideally, it'd be great if a user can just unzip one envelope (or other sub-package) for each step – that ensures that they have everything to hand without having to do extra work. But this only works if all the parts are approximately the same size, which in many cases isn't practical. In that case, consider packaging parts of the same size together; small parts can be packaged per-step (since they're relatively difficult to find and manipulate), and large parts can be bundled or boxed together. Consider using transparent material for any boxes or envelopes that parts come in, so someone can easily see inside. Resealable is nice, too, so opening an envelope doesn't require the user to keep track of everything that was once in it, even if not needed right away. You may even want to write a short guide to the contents of the box so that users can get oriented to its contents more quickly.
You might even want to include a page with a picture of the kit that labels where everything can be found.
You can make a lot of aesthetic choices about the packaging of your kit as well. For example, for an electronics kit, it might actually be nice to have relatively plain packaging such as a cardboard box. But crafters, on the other hand, might appreciate details such as nice boxes, ribbons or other decorations, or different types of tissue paper. Graphics can be printed pretty cheaply on the inside or outside of a box. 
Pricing
Pricing is obviously a key marketing decision that you'll need to make early on. Chris Anderson of Wired suggests pricing your kit at 2.3 – 2.5x the cost of parts. Though this may seem high, you'll run into lots of unexpected costs, especially as your kit grows in popularity and audience.

One of the earliest  “modern era”  DIY communities formed among amateur radio hobbyists in the 1920’s (Figure 1). These hobbyists relied on amateur handbooks, which stressed “imagination and an open mind” nearly as much as the technical aspects of radio communication [20]. Ham radio enthusiasts often met in person to discuss their work as well as unrelated social subjects. They continued to thrive rebelliously during World War II, when a ban was placed on amateur radio communication. Rebellious attitudes continued to pervade pirate radio stations of the  1960’s  and handmade ‘zines’ expressing the punk aesthetic in the 1970s’ (Figure 1) [37]. In addition, prior work provides insight into DIY practices: Torrey  et al. explore information seeking among crafters [34], while O’Connor provides an ethnographic study of glassblowing [31]. Lastly, Torrey  et al. focus on How-To documentation [35], identifying several motivations for sharing: personal documentation, online identity, and finding employment.DIY communities and projects are driven by creativity. 
The vast  majority of our respondents contribute to DIY communities not to gain employment,  money, or online fame,  but to express themselves and be inspired by new ideas.  
To compliment expressive idea exchange, future systems can explore light-weight mechanisms for gauging learning outcomes. While numerous contests and rating systems exist to indicate the popularity of online content, very few tools allow us to evaluate tacit knowledge transfer or learning experiences. Systems aiming to support scaffolding for knowledge exchange can allow users to quickly indicate how much they learned or search for content that other people have effectively learned from.
